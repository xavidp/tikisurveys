# tikisurveys
Fetch, massage and cook survey data from Tiki Trackers to produce some basic descriptive statistics in tables and charts.

Tracker data are available as a data.frame (as well as all field options for the chosen tracker, available in another data.frame), so that subsetting, filtering and custom reporting an be done a-la-R-way as usual.

The first hard work of settings things in place is done. Custom reporting is not implemented yet, since it was not needed for the basic project in which this script was developed for.

More information to come ;-)

And more coding also, as new needs arrive.
